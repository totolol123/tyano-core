TODO
====

Urgent
------

- Nothing is urgent right now! :)


Important
---------

- Migrate creature walking code to thinking cycles.
- Make NPCs walk only while there are players nearby.


Soon
----

- Broadcast message with pop-up because a server-wide red chat message will actually not be read by most players.
- Refactor talkaction system to unify commands & help system.
- Fix that one boost network socket leaks every time a new connection is accepted.
- Complete item structure refactoring.
- Find to-dos written directly in the code and migrate them here.
- Refactor chat messages to be more visible (e.g. gamemaster broadcasts, etc.)


Improvements
------------

- Improve autowalking. Currently you lag when clicking multiple times and the walking randomly ends, e.g. when a creature walks into the path.
- Add randomization to the think intervals to distribute CPU load as much as possible.
- Use C++11 random number generators. Also check if the random number generating functions are not used concurrently.
- Update remaining documentation files located in `documentation/fixme`.
- Make login server functionality a run-time option instead of a compile-time option and get rid of `__LOGIN_SERVER__`.
- Restructure old sourcecode (e.g. using namespaces and using `.hpp` instead of `.h` etc.).
- Refactor raid system to be much more reliable and easier to use. Also make non-ref's raid monsters and items disappear when the raid ended.
- Use `Scheduler` for decaying items instead of a regular task in `Game` to better distribute CPU load.
- Make items automatically disappear after a while on the ground instead of regulary cleaning the map to distribute CPU load.
- Validate that all client IDs for items are valid (`< 0xFF00 && (< 0x61 || > 0x63)`, i.e. not reserved by netcode) and have no duplicates.
- Revisit relationship between master and summon creatures regarding thinking-logic and automatic targeting.
- Replace `boots::intrusive_ptr` by `std::shared_ptr`.
- Make monsters attack other targets if they are unable to reach their current one.
- Set `BOOST_DISABLE_ASSERTS` and `NDEBUG` for release build.
- Obey a monster's targeting range when choosing a target.
- Find out what `Map::checkSightLine` does and why it swaps `x` and `z` coordinates which aren't type compatible.
- Revisit all types used for integral numbers. `intXY_t` vs. `int_leastXY_t` etc. for speed vs. memory vs. compatibility.
- Use `std::weak_ptr` where it makes sense (e.g. master->summon relationship and damage list) to avoid cyclic references.
- Check out LLVM as compiler, esp. static analysis.
- Use or develop a LUA framework.
- Further consolidate `Position`, `StackPosition` and `ExtendedPosition`.
- Migrate `TODO.md` to GitHub issues.
- Never directly use enum values as array index or size.
